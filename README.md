# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to group customers based on purchasing behavior. I used SQL for scoring, cleaned the data manually and with queries, and built a Power BI dashboard to show insights clearly.

##  What I Did

- Cleaned up raw transaction data (returns, invalid entries)
- Created RFM metrics using SQL
- Assigned customers into 8 segments based on score combinations
- Built a Power BI dashboard to explore customer behavior interactively

---

## ðŸ“¥ Dataset

This project uses the [UCI Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail), which contains over 500,000 transactions from a UK-based online retailer between 2010 and 2011.

##  Data Cleaning

- Dropped:
  - Null or blank `CustomerID`, `InvoiceNo`, and `Description`
  - Rows with negative quantity or price
  - Stock codes like `POST`, `BANK CHARGES`, `AMAZONFEE`, etc.
- Removed exact duplicates using `ROW_NUMBER()`

---

##  RFM Scoring Logic

- Recency: Days since last purchase (based on max `InvoiceDate`)
- Frequency: Count of distinct invoices
- Monetary: Sum of total spend
- Used `NTILE(5)` for scoring into 1â€“5
- Reversed Recency score (lower is better â†’ higher score)
- Combined scores into RFMCode (e.g. `555`, `421`)

Here's the SQL I used to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values:

```sql
SELECT 
  CustomerID,
  DATEDIFF(DAY, MAX(InvoiceDate), '2011-12-09') AS Recency,
  COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) AS Frequency,
  SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity) AS Monetary
FROM TransactionsCleaned
GROUP BY CustomerID;
```
To score them from 1 to 5, I used NTILE:
```
SELECT 
  CustomerID,
  6 - NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY Recency ASC) AS RecencyScore,
  NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY Frequency ASC) AS FrequencyScore,
  NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY Monetary ASC) AS MonetaryScore
FROM RFMBase;
```

##  Segmentation

Mapped RFMCode into 8 human-readable segments:

| RFM Code Pattern | Segment Name     |
|------------------|------------------|
| `555`            | Champion         |
| `5__`            | New Customer     |
| `_5_`            | Loyal Customer   |
| `__5`            | Big Spender      |
| `1__`            | At Risk          |
| `1_5`            | Canâ€™t Lose Them  |
| `111`            | Lost             |
| everything else  | Others           |

##  Power BI Dashboard

- KPI cards showing:
  - Total Customers
  - Total Revenue
  - Champions / At Risk counts
- Bar + Pie charts for segment distribution
- Interactive slicer by `SegmentName`
- Detailed customer-level table with Recency, Frequency, Monetary

##  Insights

- Loyal Customers and Others make up over half the customer base
- Champions (~8%) contribute disproportionately to revenue
- Over 700 customers are At Risk and might need a re-engagement campaign

---

##  Tools Used

- SQL Server
- Power BI
- Excel (light filtering and export)
